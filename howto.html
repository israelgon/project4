<h1><center> How to Solve </center></h1> 
<p>how to solve this is that to ask their local resturants if they can.
they can ask their manager if they can add a cash payment. 
and if they can say yes, then the workers can sell more than before because
they had a bunch of people in their resturants.but now they have less
people because not alot of people has credit cards.</p>
