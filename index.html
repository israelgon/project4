<h1>Cash to be a form of payment</h1>
<p>I want cash to be a form of payment because some restaurants now only accept credit cards but how about if you with your friends,
 but you only have cash but on each sign or they tell you
 ¨Oh we only accept credit cards now.¨ but how about if some people don't own credit cards. 
 I think that they should still have the option because some people can't afford credit cards. <p>
